plone.app.redirector to-do

 - write path storage
 - test path storage
    - VHM paths
    - Unauthorized
    
 - write view
    - Performs lookup in path storage
    - Finds object if there is exactly one
    - Tests!

 - register local utility in CMFPlone GS profile
 - make standard_error_message.py in CMFPlone aware of redirector
    - alternatively, use a view on NotFound exception (possibly dangerous)

 - Make allowances for portal_factory?
